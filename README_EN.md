HAILab is an artificial intelligence algorithm library established by the human factors engineering technology team of the Institute of intelligent manufacturing of Guangdong Academy of Sciences. The algorithm library is built based on the pytorch framework, covering general algorithms such as Reid, target detection, behavior recognition, OCR recognition, instance segmentation and target tracking, as well as crowd counting, identification of wearing specifications (helmets, reflective vests, etc.), identification of epidemic prevention clothing (masks, epidemic prevention clothes), market occupation operation detection Through code depth optimization and encapsulation, special algorithms such as temperature measurement bright code behavior, smoke recognition and flame recognition can provide users with simple and easy-to-use API call interfaces, and accelerate the innovative application of artificial intelligence algorithms in public security, smart elderly care, smart city, intelligent manufacturing and other industries.
